# python_art_data_practice
In these projects I demonstrate my knowledge of lists using artist and poet data. I use the following techniques:
- split (seperate the list by a certain character)
- strip (remove whitespace and unecessary characters from the data)
- append (make changes to the list)
- length (show how many items are in the list)
- range (to print data within a certain number range (e.g. 1-6 prints the items, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- zip (to merge two or more lists together)
