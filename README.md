# python_art_data_practice
In these projects I demonstrate my knowledge of lists using artist and poet data. I use the following techniques:
- split
- strip (remove whitespace and unecessary characters from the data)
- append (make changes to the list)
- length (see show how long a string is)
- range (
- zip (to merge two or more lists together)
